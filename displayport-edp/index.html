            Embedded Displayport as implemented by the LCD used in this project only allows two Displayport main links. Thus, only Lane0 and Lane1 from the standard Displayport connector are used. The AUX channel is used to communicate data such as the resolution supported by the screen. Other connections on the eDP connector are used for power and setting the screen brightness, which the PCB sets to always be full brightness.
